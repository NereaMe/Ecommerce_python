    <h1>Instacart Grocery Basket Analysis</h1>

    <p>I am an analyst for Instacart, an online grocery store that operates through an app. Using Python, I have performed an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation. Instacart already has very good sales, but they want to uncover more information about their sales patterns.</p>

    <h2>Data Analysis Project</h2>
    <h3>Objective:</h3>
    <p>As a data analyst, my objective is to analyze the variety of customers in Instacart's database and understand their purchasing behaviors. Instacart stakeholders aim to implement a targeted marketing strategy tailored to different customer segments to improve product sales. This analysis will guide the development of a strategy to ensure Instacart effectively targets the right customer profiles with the appropriate products.</p>

    <h3>Key questions to address include:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>What are the busiest days and times?</li>
        <li>What products are the most popular?</li>
        <li>What is the distribution among users regarding their brand loyalty?</li>
        <li>What differences can you find in the ordering habits of different customer profiles?</li>
        <li>Is there a connection between age and marital status in terms of ordering habits?</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Data Source</h3>
    <p>The project leverages open-source datasets from Instacart, complemented by specially created customer datasets. These resources are integral to addressing the outlined business questions.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.instacart.com/datasets/grocery-shopping-2017" target="_blank">Instacart Data Sets</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Stakeholders</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The Vice President of Marketing</li>
        <li>The Senior Vice President of Sales</li>
        <li>Instacart Customers</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Stakeholders want to enhance targeting for ad campaigns and understand which part of the offering has the lowest market share, and why, to improve and boost sales. Additionally, Instacart customers desire to receive ads, promotions, and recommendations that are relevant to the products they order regularly.</p>

    <h3>Deliverables</h3>
    <p>For a thorough understanding of my findings and recommendations, please consult the Final Project PDF along with the Instacart Basket Analysis 2-2024 zip file, which includes all datasets, graphs, and reports.</p>
